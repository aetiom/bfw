# Added namespaces

Some namespaces are added by the subsystem `ComposerLoader`.
There are added to the format [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) on Composer autoloader.

The list is :
* `\Controller` : For items who are into the directory `src/controllers/`
* `\Modeles` : For items who are into the directory `src/modeles/`
* `\Modules` : For items who are into the directory `app/modules/`
